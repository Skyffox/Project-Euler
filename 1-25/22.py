# Using names.txt containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting
# it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each
# name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain
# a name score.

# For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is
# worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN
# would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.

# What is the total of all the name scores in the file?

# All letters
letters = ['A','B','C','D','E','F','G','H','I','J','K','L','M','N','O','P','Q','R','S','T','U','V','W','X','Y','Z']

# Read in the data
