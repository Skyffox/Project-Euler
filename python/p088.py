Problem 88: Product-sum numbers

Problem description:
A natural number N can be written as the sum and product of a set of at least two natural numbers. Such a number is called a product-sum number. For example:
    6 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 * 2 * 3
The task is to find the sum of all distinct minimum product-sum numbers for all values of k â‰¥ 2. 
For each k, minSumProduct[k] is the smallest number that can be expressed as both the sum and the product of exactly k positive integers.
