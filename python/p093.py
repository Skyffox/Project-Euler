Project Euler Problem 93: Arithmetic Expressions

Problem description:
From a set of four distinct digits, generate expressions using +, âˆ’, *, and / to produce the longest set of consecutive 
positive integers starting from 1. The goal is to determine which set of four digits produces the longest consecutive run.
