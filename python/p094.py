Project Euler Problem 94: Almost Equilateral Triangles

Problem description:
An almost equilateral triangle is a triangle with side lengths (a, a, c), where c is either a+1 or a-1.
The height of the triangle can be computed using a right triangle with half the base (c/2) and side length a as the hypotenuse.

To produce a valid integer area, both the height (h) and half the base (c/2) must be integers, and (h, c/2, a) must be a Pythagorean triple.

Find the sum of the perimeters of all almost equilateral triangles with integer areas and perimeter â‰¤ 1,000,000,000.

    """
    This function calculates the sum of the perimeters of all almost equilateral 
    triangles with integer side lengths, where the perimeter does not exceed LIMIT (10^9).
    These triangles have side lengths in the form of (c, c, c +/- 1), where c is the integer 
    hypotenuse, and a^2 + b^2 = c^2 holds for the right triangle formed by splitting the 
    equilateral triangle down the middle.

    The solution uses primitive Pythagorean triples and iterates over possible values of 
    s and t that generate valid triples. It checks for the condition that either a*2 = c - 1 or 
    a*2 = c + 1 or the same conditions with b.

    Returns:
        str: The total sum of the perimeters of all valid almost equilateral triangles with integer sides
             where the perimeter does not exceed 10^9.
